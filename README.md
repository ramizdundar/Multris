# Multris
This is a tetris game where there is one board but two players :)

## Requirements
Python 3 is required. Pygame is also required by I highly suggest running the commands in the setup section as it already installs pygame.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ramizdundar/Multris.git
cd Multris
python -m venv venv
source activate venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pygame
```

## Run
Just run the setup commands in two different computer and run the command below in both computers
```
python main.py
```
Multris will automatically find and connect games.

## Gameplay
Use arrow keys to move or rotate the figure and use space in order to make figure fall botttom. You can use escape key to reset the game.
